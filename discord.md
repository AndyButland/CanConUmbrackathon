# A Guide to the Candid Contributions Discord Server

## Notification Settings

Hopefully there will be a lot of discussions happening and, if you don't turn them off, notifications can get quite annoying!

To change them click on ‘Candid Contribs’ top left, select 'Notification Settings' and change them to be 'Mentions Only'.

If you want to be notified on a specific channel then you can change notifications on that channel directly. 

## Your Profile

It would be really useful if your nickname was recognisably ‘you’. Helps people put a face to a name from the Zoom call (assuming your video is on!)

If you need to change it, click on ‘Candid Contribs’ top left, then ‘Change Nickname’. Your name will change only on this Discord server, not others.

## Shared Music

At hackathons we really enjoy listening to the same music in the background. Sometimes there is silence in the Zoom call so if you're a fan of background music then why not listen to the same as everyone else!

If you want to join us, click on the `MUSIC` > `#music to hack to` audio channel.

To adjust the music volume specifically (so it can be quieter to the voices on the zoom call), right click on Groovy (the bot we’re using) and alter its volume.

If you want to help keep the music playing, over on the `MUSIC` > `#be-the-dj` text channel type:

  `-queue {spotify url}`, or

  `-queue {name of song/artist}`

  Type `-help` for more commands
