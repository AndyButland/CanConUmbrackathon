# Sweet Potato and Peanut Stew

This is a nice bit of a comfort food that you can throw together quickly and enjoy for days. It's crazy cheap, can be cooked in one pot
and full of vitamins and whatever else is really good for you. 

* 4 medium sized sweet potatoes - peeled and diced (2cm sq is fine)
* 120g peanut butter (crunchy is better)
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 medium onion
* 1 tin of tomatoes (400g)
* 100g spinach
* 500ml veg stock
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoons tomato puree
* small bunch of fresh corriander

---------

Add the olive oil to wide-bottomed saucepan or frying pan.
Heat up on a low to medium heat.
Peel and roughly chop the onions and add to the hot oil.
While the onions cook, pick the corriander leaves from the stalks and chop the stalks.
Put the leaves you've picked into a small bowl of cold water to keep them from wilting.
When the onions are translucent (but don't let them brown), add the chopped corriander stalks and sweet potatoes.
Cook for a further 3 minutes.  
Add the tomato puree and the peanut butter and mix together.
Crush the garlic into the paste and stir.
In a measuring jug, mix the tinned tomatoes and stock.
Add the stock and tomato mixture to the pan until all combined. 
Put a lid on the pan and simmer for 15 mins or until the sweet potato is soft.
Take the lid off and cook on a high heat for a further 5 mins.
Your sauce should be nice and thick now - remove it from the heat and add the spinach.
Stir to wilt.

Serve with rice, crusty bread, chips or on its own. Sprinkle the corriander leaves over the serving. This meal tastes even better as leftovers so it's 
always worth making too much :)
