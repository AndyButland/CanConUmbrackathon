# Contribution Suggestions

When you've found an issue that you'd like to work on, do a bit of initial investigation to decide if you're going to give it a go. If you are then please add a comment that you will be working on it. That should prevent other people wasting effort by working on the same thing.

## Umbraco CMS

This is an Umbraco hackathon so, of course, first we should highlight working on the source code of the CMS itself!

- [Core Collaborators' CMS Hacktoberfest suggestions](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#CMS)

- [`community/up-for-grabs` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs)

- [`good first issue` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/labels/good%20first%20issue)

- [Umbraco CMS contributing guide](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/blob/v8/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Members of the Umbraco Core Collaborators team will be at the hackathon to answer any questions you may have. 

### Umbraco .NET Core

If you'd like to help with the migration of the CMS to .NET core, [read this .NET core specific guide](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#net).

## Umbraco Documentation

The Umbraco documentation is managed as a collection of markdown files on GitHub. 

- [Documentation Curators' Docs Hacktoberfest suggestions](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#docs)

- [Umbraco Docs contributing guide](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Hopefully there will be some experienced 'documentors' at the hackathon to provide any guidance needed.

## Umbraco Packages

This year, for the first time, contributions to open source Umbraco packages will count towards the Umbraco Hacktoberfest challenge.

The Umbraco Package team have been asking package maintainers to submit their repositories for contribution.

- Visit https://umbra.co/packtoberfest for the list of packages 

Some package maintainers, and members of the Umbraco Package Team, will be at the hackathon to help out.

## Our Umbraco

The community site for Umbraco, [our.umbraco.com](https://our.umbraco.com/) is itself an open source project. It's quite an old code base so unless there is recent, clear guidance on an issue, we recommend checking first as to whether the issue is worth working on.

- [Our `up-for-grabs` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs)

- [Our package section issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs) (these are managed on the Package Team repo)

- [Our contribution guide](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco)

## Other Ways to Contribute

It's not all code or documentation. There are other ways that you make a big contribution to the Umbraco ecosystem. 

### Issue Triage

Look at the [CMS issues list with the oldest ones first](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc). A massive contribution would be to go through these old issues and investigate whether the issue is still present; perhaps it's been fixed already! Take some screenshots of what you've discovered and add full details to the issue. You don't need to go anywhere the source code for this! [Install the latest version of Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/getting-started/setup/install/) locally and get testing!

### Test the Latest Release Candidate

Umbraco v8.9.0 is scheduled for release just after the hackathon. Umbraco HQ [wrote a blog post](https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-89-release-candidate/) explaining how people could contribute by helping to test the RC.

Obviously the sooner the better for any issues to be reported, so why not try upgrading an existing project and get testing.

### Write a Blog Post

Sharing knowledge and experience is a wonderful contribution to make. If you fancy writing a blog post, here are a couple of places looking for authors:

- [**Skrift Magazine**](https://skrift.io/write/) is a community magazine for Umbraco. They publish original articles about developing in Umbraco as well as user experience, design, front-end technologies and broader issues like improving the Umbraco community and quality of life.

- [**24 days in Umbraco**](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/faq/) is the Umbraco Christmas Calendar. They publish an article every day in the run up to Christmas. They are currently [asking people to submit suggestions](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/write-for-us/) for this December.

## Still Not Found Anything?

Have a look through all the [Umbraco GitHub repos](https://github.com/umbraco) for their open issues, such as:

- [**UmbPack**](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbPack/issues) - a CLI tool to use in CI/CD to upload Umbraco .zip packages to the Our package repository

- [**Package.Templates**](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/issues) - some dotnet new templates for starting Umbraco package projects.

Or give a shout out on Zoom/Discord and let's see if we can pair you up with someone and help them!
