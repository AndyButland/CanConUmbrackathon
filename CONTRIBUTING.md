# Umbraco Contribution Suggestions

If you're looking for inspiration on how you can contribute to the Umbraco ecosystem then you're in the right place!

For code contributions, looking through issues lists on GitHub repositories is a good place to start. We've highlighted lots of options below. When you've found an issue that you'd like to work on - and done a quick investigation to confirm you understand what's involved - please add a comment that you will be working on it. That should prevent other people wasting effort on the same issue.

We've also included some suggestions on non-code contributions that you can make too. They may not count towards Hacktoberfest swag, but they really are highly valuable!

## Umbraco CMS

This is an Umbraco hackathon so we should highlight working on the source code of the CMS first!

- Read the [Core Collaborators' CMS Hacktoberfest post](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#CMS)

- Search [`community/up-for-grabs` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs)

- Search [`good first issue` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/labels/good%20first%20issue)

- [Umbraco CMS contributing guide](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/blob/v8/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Members of the Umbraco Core Collaborators team will be at the hackathon to answer any questions. 

### Umbraco .NET Core

If you'd like to help with the migration of the CMS to .NET core, read the [specific .NET core contribution guidelines](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#net).

## Umbraco Documentation

The Umbraco documentation is managed as a collection of markdown files on GitHub. 

- Read the [Documentation Curators' Docs Hacktoberfest post](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#docs)

- [Umbraco Docs contributing guide](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

There will be some experienced documenters at the hackathon to provide any guidance needed.

## Umbraco Packages

This year, for the first time, contributions to open source Umbraco packages will count towards the Umbraco Hacktoberfest challenge.

- Visit https://umbra.co/packtoberfest for the list of packages that are looking for contributors

Members of the Umbraco Package Team, and maybe the package maintainers themselves, will be at the hackathon to help out.

## Our Umbraco

The community site for Umbraco, [our.umbraco.com](https://our.umbraco.com/) is itself an open source project. It's quite an old code base so unless there is recent, clear guidance on an issue, we recommend checking first as to whether the issue is worth working on.

- [Our `up-for-grabs` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs)

- [Our package section issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs) (these are managed on the Package Team repo)

- [Our contribution guide](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco)

## Other Ways to Contribute

It's not all code or documentation. There are other ways that you make a *big* contribution to the Umbraco ecosystem. 

### Issue Triage

There are [old issues on the CMS](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc) that may have been fixed already, or are no longer relevant. A massive contribution would be to investigate an old issue and confirm its current status. Take some screenshots of what you've discovered and add full details to the issue. You don't need to go anywhere the source code for this!

### Test the latest Release Candidate

Umbraco v8.9.0 is scheduled for release just after the hackathon. Umbraco HQ [wrote a blog post](https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-89-release-candidate/) explaining how people could contribute by helping to test the RC.

Obviously the sooner the better for any issues to be reported, so why not try upgrading an existing project and get testing today!

### Answer some Forum Posts

Helping people out on the [Our Umbraco Forum](https://our.umbraco.com/forum/) is an excellent way to improve your own knowledge, as well as helping other people. You can't explain a concept to someone else without really understanding it yourself. Or perhaps the problem will need you to do some investigation of your own. We can help find you a 'forum buddy' if you fancy giving this a go with someone else!

### Write a Blog Post

Sharing knowledge and experience is a wonderful contribution to make. If you fancy writing a blog post, here are a couple of places looking for authors:

- [**Skrift Magazine**](https://skrift.io/write/) is a community magazine for Umbraco. They publish original articles about developing in Umbraco as well as user experience, design, front-end technologies and broader issues like improving the Umbraco community and quality of life.

- [**24 days in Umbraco**](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/faq/) is the Umbraco Christmas Calendar. They publish an article every day in the run up to Christmas. They are currently [asking people to submit suggestions](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/write-for-us/) for this December.

## Still Not Found Anything?

Have a look through all the [Umbraco GitHub repos](https://github.com/umbraco) for their open issues, such as:

- [**UmbPack**](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbPack/issues) - a CLI tool to use in CI/CD to upload Umbraco .zip packages to the Our package repository

- [**Package.Templates**](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/issues) - some dotnet new templates for starting Umbraco package projects.

Or give a shout out on Zoom/Discord and let's see if we can pair you up with someone and help them!
