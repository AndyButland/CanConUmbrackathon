# Welcome to the CanCon Hacktoberfest Umbrackathon!

The full schedule and sign up form is on our website: https://candidcontributions.com/umbrackathon.

Once you've signed up you will get a link to our Discord server. Please join us over there and say hello!

## How will the Hackathon work?

The hackathon will run over Zoom; the link will be emailed to all participants the day before. You are welcome to come and go throughout the event. At least two hosts will be on the call at all times, so there will always be someone to welcome you and help out when needed.

Don't worry if you don't know what you want to 'work' on during the hackathon, we've curated a list for you:

### - [The CanCon suggested places to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you want to get started before the hackathon, and get a feel for what you'd like to do, please go ahead! If you would like to collaborate with other people then mention this over on Discord and let's see if we can make that happen. There are various tools that we can use to aid working together such as Zoom breakout rooms, Discord voice calls, and Visual Studio Live Share. Remote collaboration is possible!

## Your Hackathon Aims

If your aim is to earn an _official_ Hacktoberfest t-shirt, or get a tree planted, you will need to make *four* pull requests to repositories that are labeled with the `hacktoberfest` topic. If you want to achieve the _Umbraco_ Hacktoberfest challenge then you need to make *one* pull request to any of the places that we have listed for you. But don't feel obliged to work on things suggested, what you do is really up to you!
