# Welcome to the CanCon Hacktoberfest UmbrackathonüçÑ!

The full schedule and sign up form is on our website: https://candidcontributions.com/umbrackathon.

Once you've signed up you will get a link to our Discord server. Please join us over there and say hello!

## What happens at the Hackathon?

The hackathon will be run over Zoom; the link for which will be emailed to you the day before. Participants are welcome to come and go throughout. At least two hosts will be on the call at all times, so there will always be someone to welcome you and help out when needed.

If you don't know what you want to 'work' on during the hackathon then don't worry! We've put a list of suggestions below. If you want to get started before the hackathon, and get a feel for what you'd like to do, please go ahead! If you would like to collaborate with other people then mention this over on Discord and let's see if we can make that happen. There are various tools that we can use to aid working together such as Zoom breakout rooms, Discord voice calls, and Visual Studio Live Share. Remote collaboration is possible!

## Hackathon Aims

If your aim is to earn an official Hacktoberfest t-shirt, or get a tree planted, you will need to make *four* pull requests to repositories that are labeled with the `hacktoberfest` topic. 

If you want to achieve the Umbraco Hacktoberfest challenge then you need to make *one* pull request to any of the places that are listed below. 

But don't feel obliged to work on things suggested here, what you do is really up to you!

## Contribution Suggestions

When you've found an issue that you'd like to work on, do a bit of initial investigation to decide you're going to give it a go. If you are then please add a comment that you will be working on it. That should prevent other people wasting effort by working on the same thing.

### Umbraco CMS

This is an Umbraco hackathon so, of course, first we should highlight working on the source code of the CMS itself!

- [Core Collaborators' CMS Hacktoberfest suggestions](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#CMS)

- [`community/up-for-grabs` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs)

- [`good first issue` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/labels/good%20first%20issue)

- [Umbraco CMS contributing guide](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/blob/v8/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Members of the Umbraco Core Collaborators team will be at the hackathon to answer any questions you may have. 

#### Umbraco .NET Core

If you'd like to help with the migration of the CMS to .NET core, [read this .NET core specific guide](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#net).

### Umbraco Documentation

The Umbraco documentation is managed as a collection of markdown files in on GitHub. 

- [Documentation Curators' Docs Hacktoberfest suggestions](https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020/#docs)

- [Umbraco Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs)

Hopefully there will be some experienced 'documentors' at the hackathon to provide any guidance needed.

### Umbraco Packages

This year, for the first time, contributions to open source Umbraco packages will count towards the Umbraco Hacktoberfest challenge.

The Umbraco Package team have been asking package maintainers to get their issues lists in order(!) and then submit them for contribution.

- Visit https://umbra.co/packtoberfest for the list of submitted packages 

Some package maintainers, and members of the Umbraco Package Team, will be at the hackathon to help out.

### Our Umbraco

The community site for Umbraco, [our.umbraco.com](https://our.umbraco.com/) is itself an open source project. It's quite an old code base so unless there is recent, clear guidance on an issue, we recommend checking first as to whether the issue is worth working on.

- [Our `up-for-grabs` issues](https://github.com/umbraco/OurUmbraco/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs)

- [Our package section issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/labels/community%2Fup-for-grabs) (these are managed on the Package Team repo)

## Other Ways to Contribute

It's not all code or documentation. There are other ways that you make a big contribution to the Umbraco ecosystem. 

### Issue Triage

Look at the CMS [issues list with the oldest ones first](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc). A massive contribution would be to go through these old issues and investigate whether the issue is still present; perhaps it's been fixed already! Take some screenshots of what you've discovered and add full details to the issue. You don't need to go anywhere source code for this! [Install the latest version of Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/getting-started/setup/install/) locally and get testing!

### Test the Latest Release Candidate

Umbraco v8.9.0 is scheduled for release just after the hackathon. 

HQ [wrote a blog post](https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-89-release-candidate/) explaining how people could contribute by helping to test the RC.

Obviously the sooner the better for any issues to be reported, so why not try upgrading an existing project today!

### Write a Blog Post

Sharing knowledge and experience is a wonderful contribution to make. If you fancy writing a blog post, here are a couple of places looking for authors:

- [**Skrift Magazine**](https://skrift.io/write/) is a community magazine for Umbraco. They publish original articles about developing in Umbraco as well as user experience, design, front-end technologies and broader issues like improving the Umbraco community and quality of life.

- [**24 days in Umbraco**](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/faq/) is the Umbraco Christmas Calendar. They publish an article every day in the run up to Christmas. They are currently [asking people to submit suggestions](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/write-for-us/) for this December.

## Still Not Found Anything?

Have a look through all the [Umbraco GitHub repos](https://github.com/umbraco) for their open issues, such as:

- [**UmbPack**](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbPack/issues) - a CLI tool to use in CI/CD to upload Umbraco .zip packages to the Our package repository

- [**Package.Templates**](https://github.com/umbraco/Package.Templates/issues) - some dotnet new templates for starting Umbraco package projects.

Or give a shout out on Zoom/Discord and let's see if we can pair you up with someone and help them!
